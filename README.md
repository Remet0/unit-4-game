Intsructions:

 Every character has unique attack, counterattack and health points. Choose a character you will want to play as. Your possible enemies will then be poopulated. Choose which enemy you want to fight first, they are on the defense. Press attack to attack the enemy, dealing damaged based on your characters attack power. The defender will then counterattack dealing damage to you. As you fight you will power up, dealing more damage. However after each enemy your power is cut in thirds due to your character getting tired. Defeate all the enemies to win the game.
